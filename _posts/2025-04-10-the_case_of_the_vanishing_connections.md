You know that sinking feeling when a test fails, but rerunning it magically makes it pass? That ‚Äúuh oh, is this flaky?‚Äù moment. Yeah, we‚Äôve been there. And recently, while working on the [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) client library, we hit one of those elusive intermittent failures that had us scratching our heads.
Here‚Äôs how we tracked it down, what we found, and how we fixed it.

## The Mystery
It started with this gem of a failure in GitHub Actions:

```
--- FAIL: TestUsersService_DeleteKey (0.00s)
    users_keys_test.go:170: Users.DeleteKey returned error: 
    Delete "http://127.0.0.1:40547/api-v3/user/keys/1": 
    net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: http: CloseIdleConnections called
```

No consistent pattern. No specific test always failing. Just a flaky mess that would go green when you hit "Re-run jobs". Classic.

## First Clue

The only thing that had changed? We‚Äôd recently added **t.Parallel()** to speed up the test suite. And while it did make things faster, it also introduced a new problem: flaky tests showing up like uninvited guests.  
That was our first real clue. This wasn‚Äôt a typical test failure. It had all the signs of a race condition. One that had been hiding quietly in the background until parallelism brought it into the spotlight.

## The Hidden Culprit: Shared Transport Pitfalls

Turns out the tests were unknowingly sharing the same underlying HTTP transport. Here's what was happening:

* Each test spins up its own HTTP server and client.
* But the clients don‚Äôt specify a custom transport.
* So they all fall back to Go‚Äôs http.DefaultTransport.

And this is where it gets spicy.  

When one test finishes, it calls server.Close(). This doesn‚Äôt just shut down the test server ‚Äî it also calls CloseIdleConnections() on the shared default transport.  

So what happens if another test is running at that exact moment and tries to reuse a connection from that shared pool?  

Boom. ‚ÄúConnection broken.‚Äù 

## A Look Under the Hood

Since our bug centered around HTTP transport behavior, it's worth diving deeper into how Go's transport system actually works.
The http.Transport is the workhorse behind Go's HTTP client operations. It implements the RoundTripper interface, which is responsible for executing a single HTTP transaction. More importantly, it manages the complex lifecycle of network connections.
At its core, the transport's job is to:  

* Establish TCP connections to servers  
* Handle connection pooling and reuse  
* Manage TLS handshakes for HTTPS  
* Apply protocol-specific behaviors (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2)  
* Deal with proxies, if configured  

Connection pooling is where the magic happens. When a request completes, the transport doesn't immediately close the connection. Instead, it returns it to an internal pool for potential reuse. This connection reuse is a critical optimization that saves the overhead of establishing new TCP connections (and TLS handshakes) for subsequent requests to the same host.  

By default, if you don‚Äôt [explicitly set a transport](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/v70.0.0/github/github_test.go#L62) when creating an [http.Client](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/v70.0.0/github/github.go#L332), Go will fall back to using the global http.DefaultTransport. You can see this in [Go‚Äôs source code](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/client.go#L199-L204). 

```
func (c *Client) transport() RoundTripper {
	if c.Transport != nil {
		return c.Transport
	}
	return DefaultTransport
}
```

So even if our tests were spinning up new clients and servers, they were still quietly sharing the same underlying transport.

**Where CloseIdleConnections() Is Likely Being Called:**  
When a test completes, it calls [server.Close()](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/v70.0.0/github/github_test.go#L67), which triggers:  
* Closing the test's HTTP server  
* Closing any connections to that server that are in StateIdle or StateNew  
* Calling CloseIdleConnections() on the default transport, which affects all idle connections in the shared pool   

Here‚Äôs the relevant snippet from [httptest.Server.Close()](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/net/http/httptest/server.go#L237-L242)  

```
	if t, ok := http.DefaultTransport.(closeIdleTransport); ok {
		t.CloseIdleConnections()
	}

	// Also close the client idle connections.
	if s.client != nil {
		if t, ok := s.client.Transport.(closeIdleTransport); ok {
			t.CloseIdleConnections()
		}
	}
```

This is the key piece that causes the race condition. When one test finishes and shuts down its server, it closes idle connections across the shared transport ‚Äî possibly interrupting other tests that are still running.

## Why It Was So Intermittent

This was a timing issue ‚Äî a race condition in disguise:
1. Test A finishes and calls server.Close().
2. Go‚Äôs default transport clears idle connections, including ones Test B might want.
3. Test B tries to use a now-dead connection.
4. üí• Test B fails.

But only sometimes, because this only happens if Test A and Test B hit that exact timing window. That‚Äôs what made it so infuriating to reproduce and debug.

## The Fix: Isolate Those Transports

Once we identified the shared http.Transport as the villain, the solution was simple: don‚Äôt share.  
Each test now gets its own http.Client with a unique Transport. That way, when one test closes its server and kills its connections, it doesn‚Äôt mess with others.  

```
func NewClient(httpClient *http.Client) *Client {
	if httpClient == nil {
		httpClient = &http.Client{}
	}
	httpClient2 := *httpClient
	c := &Client{client: &httpClient2}
	c.initialize()
	return c
}

```

[Before](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/v70.0.0/github/github_test.go#L60-L62):

```
client = NewClient(nil)
```

[After](https://github.com/google/go-github/blob/master/github/github_test.go#L60-L81):

```
	// Create a custom transport with isolated connection pool
	transport := &http.Transport{
		// Controls connection reuse - false allows reuse, true forces new connections for each request
		DisableKeepAlives: false,
		// Maximum concurrent connections per host (active + idle)
		MaxConnsPerHost: 10,
		// Maximum idle connections maintained per host for reuse
		MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 5,
		// Maximum total idle connections across all hosts
		MaxIdleConns: 20,
		// How long an idle connection remains in the pool before being closed
		IdleConnTimeout: 20 * time.Second,
	}

	// Create HTTP client with the isolated transport
	httpClient := &http.Client{
		Transport: transport,
		Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
	}
	// client is the GitHub client being tested and is
	// configured to use test server.
	client = NewClient(httpClient)
```


Here‚Äôs the PR with the fix:  
üëâ [#3529](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/3529)  
And the diff is satisfyingly small. One of those ‚Äútiny change, huge impact‚Äù moments.  

## Lessons Learned

* Go‚Äôs http.DefaultTransport is global ‚Äî respect it, or better yet, don‚Äôt use it in tests.
* Intermittent failures are usually timing bugs. If reruns help, look for shared state.
* Debugging tests is a great way to learn the real internals of the language.

## Final Thoughts

This was a fun (and slightly maddening) bug to track down, but it‚Äôs a good reminder: isolation in tests isn‚Äôt just about data ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about infrastructure, like network connections.  
Next time your test randomly breaks with a weird ‚Äúconnection broken‚Äù message, maybe check who else is playing in the same sandbox.  
Happy debugging! üêõüîç
